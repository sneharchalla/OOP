# motif-mark

This project is for identifying the motifs in a sequence.   

The input files are:  
- one motif file (which has the motif's listed)
- one sequence file (which has the sequences with the motifs)

The script uses the motif file and parses the sequence file to find all the motifs and then graphically represents the motifs as vertical lines, introns as horizontal lines and exons as rectangular boxes. Each of the different motif is represented with a different color. The motif's, introns and exons are all drawn to scale. Each sequence is represented on a separate line.
